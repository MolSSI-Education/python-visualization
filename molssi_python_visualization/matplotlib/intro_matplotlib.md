Creating Plots using Matplotlib
===============================

In this section, we will be creating plots using the python library `matplotlib`.  Matplotlib is perhaps the most widely used python plotting library. 

You can see the documentation for the Matplotlib library [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) or read more about its history [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/history.html).
