    "In order to plot and create visualizations with our data, we first have to get it into a form that python can recongize and work with. We will be using the python library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). To read in our text files. Pandas is a library that is very widely used in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `pandas`, you can read data into python and work with your data. The data we want to work with are in `.csv` files, or `comma separated value` files. The first file we will work with is called `s_orbitals_1D.csv`. This text file contains the value of the 1s, 2s and 3s orbitals in the xy plane for different values of x. If you examine this in a text editor, you will see there is a header, rows, and that values are separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can easily read this type of file using a function called `read_csv`. You can also open files like this in Excel, or even save csv files from Excel. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will need to import pandas. The pandas library is usually shortened to `pd`. We will use the function `pd.read_csv` to read the csv file."
